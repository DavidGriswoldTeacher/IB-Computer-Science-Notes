# Graded IB Computer Science Notes Page

This page will store notes made by Mr. Griswold for students in IB Computer Science. It will be updated and edited over time, but old versions will be archived.

### [See the version of these notes used from 2019-2020](./2019/index.md)

The table of contents below is broken into three sections - general course resources, Programming Notes, and Non-Programming Notes. A significant portion of this class will be devoted to learning to program computers in java, and we will use the website CodeHS.ccom to help us with that. However, in each unit we will also cover at least a little non-programming content, which will be in its own section. 

# Table of Contents

## Programming Notes

These notes will be correlated with the programming we are doing in CodeHS, and will expand upon them. It is expected that you will read these as we work through CodeHS, and tests will draw from these notes as well as skills from CodeHS.

### Unit 1

* [P.1.2 - Printing in Java](./programming/p1.2_printing.md)

* [P.1.3 - Variables and data types](./programming/p1.3_variables.md)

* [P.1.4 - Operators and Assignment](./programming/p1.4_operators.md)
{% comment %}  
* [P.1.5 - Compound Assignment](./programming/p1.5_compoundassignment.md)

* [P.1.6 - User Input](./programming/p1.6_userinput.md)

* [P.1.7 - Casting](./programming/p1.7_casting.md)
{% endcomment %}

## Non-programming Notes

These notes cover content not included in CodeHS, because they are not about programming. They are organized in the order we will learn about them, rather than directly with the IB Syllabus.
  
### Unit 1 - Components of a Computer System and Computer Architecture (Topics 1/2)

These notes for this unit will cover the [Components of a Computer System](./resources/syllabus.md#components-of-a-computer-system),  [Computer Architecture](./resources/syllabus.md#computer-architecture), and [Secondary Memory](./resources/syllabus.md#secondary-memory) sections of the IB syllabus. 

* [NP.1.1 - Abstraction and the Elements of a Computer System](./nonprogramming/np1.1_abstraction.md)

* [NP.1.2 - Memory and Storage](./nonprogramming/np1.2_memory.md)

* [NP.1.3 - Computer Processor Architecture](./nonprogramming/np1.3_architecture.md)

* [NP 1.4 - Software, the OS, and Programming languages](./nonprogramming/np1.4_software.md)

* [NP 1.5 - The Operationg System (HL Only)](./nonprogramming/np1.5_operating_system.md)

### Unit 2 - Data representation and Logic Gates

These notes cover the [Representation](./resources/syllabus.md#representation) and [Simple Logic Gates](./resources/syllabus.md#simple-logic-gates) section of the IB syllabus, finishing up the remaining elements from Topic 2!

* [NP 2.1 - Representing integers with binary, hexadecimal, and two's complement](nonprogramming/np2.1_representing_integers.md)

* [NP 2.2 - Representing characters on computers](nonprogramming/np2.2_representing_characters.md)

## Course Resources

* [Official IB Syllabus](./resources/syllabus.md). In the notes, when a section connects directly to this syllabus, it will be represented with a superscript, like<sup>this</sup>.

* [CodeHS](http://www.codehs.com). This is the primary online platform we will use to learn to program in Java.
  
* [Traced algorithms and coding problems](./resources/traced_algorithms.md). I will add coding problems and traced algorithms to this page, over time, for you to view and practice with.

* [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/java). Coding practice in java
  
* [IA Information](./resources/ia.md)

* [Sample IA Made in Class by Mr. G](./resources/sample_ia.md)

* [The IB CS Guide](https://ib.compscihub.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IBCompSciGuide.pdf) - Includes the full syllabus (as a PDF, rather than the website above) and IA guidelines among other things

* [CompSciHub About page](https://ib.compscihub.net/about) - This excellent resource put together by IB CS teachers and students compiles notes and information about the course.

* [Paul Baumgarten's IB CS Page](https://pbaumgarten.com/ib-compsci//) - Paul Baumgarten is a long-time IB CS teacher and active contributor to the community. His page includes notes and exercises on nearly all IB topics, as well as links to even more resources. The order is different than our course, but an excellent resource for studying or reading new perspectives.
