# Graded IB Computer Science Notes

Notes for Graded's IB Computer Science classes, 2019-2020.

[The full official IB syllabus can be found here](/unit0_resources/syllabus.md). In the notes, when a section connects to this syllabus, it will be represented with a superscript, like<sup>this</sup>

These notes will be complemented by *assignments* that will be provided to you through Github via Google Classroom. Think of this page as a textbook, and the assignments as, well, assignments.

### Other Resources

* [CompSciHub About page](https://ib.compscihub.net/about) - This excellent resource put together by IB CS teachers and students compiles notes and information about the course.

* [Paul Baumgarten's IB CS Page](https://pbaumgarten.com/dp-compsci/) - Paul Baumgarten is a long-time IB CS teacher and active contributor to the community. His page includes notes and exercises on nearly all IB topics, as well as links to even more resources. The order is different than our course, but an excellent resource for studying or reading new perspectives.

* [The Beauty and Joy of Computing](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/course/bjc4nyc.html) Berkeley's computer science course for freshmen, aligned to the AP Computer Science Principles exam, contains lots of valuable information mixed in its programming exercises. Check out Unit 6 for good content review notes, unit 5 for some interesting conceptual challenges, and Unit 4 for some valuable information about networks and the internet.
