# Teacher Notes

These notes are not intended for students to read, though they cetainly can. I am using them to help me sequence out the year. They may only make sense to me, the author.

## Big ideas

### Assessments

* Every unit has a test on content (spiraled)
* Every unit has a programming project
* Formative / practice assignments every day, done in and out of class, include programming AND content review


## First Intro day (only 20 minutes probably)

Do a quick algorithm-tracing activity in teams, linked below.

[Euclid's Algorithm](unit1/media/euclid.svg)

## Unit 1 - Storage, Data, and Collections

### [Learning Targets](unit1/00_Learning_Targets.md)

### Project

Madlibs (complete the project. Involves functions, various data types, and arrays.)



## Unit 2 - Objects and Abstractions

### [Learning Targets](unit2/00_Learning_Targets.md)

### Project

Flashcards. Students design an object structure for holding and displaying flashcards.
