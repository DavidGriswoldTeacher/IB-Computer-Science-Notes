# Teacher Notes

These notes are not intended for students to read, though they cetainly can. I am using them to help me sequence out the year. They may only make sense to me, the author.

## Big ideas

### Assessments

* Every unit has a test on content (spiraled)
* Every unit has a programming project
* Formative / practice assignments every day, done in and out of class, include programming AND content review




## Unit 1 - Storage, Data, and Collections
