# Welcome!
## Let's install (and learn about) some software!

If there is one thing that is true about writing your own computer software - a major element of this course and our focus for the first semester - it is that it takes software to make software. 

Part of my goal as a teacher is to get you comfortable with the way *real computer programmers* use software to make software; that starts today.

Today we will do FOUR major software things. Click each link, follow the instructions, then click back to get back here.
1. [Open and practice with the *command line*](commandline.md)
2. [Install a *package manager*](packagemanager.md)
3. [Install Visual Studio Code](visualstudiocode.md)
4. [Install git and set up Github](gitandgithub.md)
5. [Install javascript and Typescript commandline tools](typescript_commandline.md)

Wow, that was a lot of software!
