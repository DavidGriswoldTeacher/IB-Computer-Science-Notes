## Topic 4—Computational thinking, problem-solving and programming (45 hours)

### 4.1 General principles (10 hours)

> This should not be taught as a separate topic but must be incorporated and connected to all sections— especially flow charts, pseudocode and programming in the SL/HL core and abstract data structures (HL extension). It is essential that these elements are not addressed in isolation—they have to be approached as a whole.

> The basic ideas and their application should be illustrated with non-computer examples. Each basic idea should then be practised in specific algorithmic contexts using concepts drawn from flow charts, pseudocode and programming. The teacher support material illustrates examples such as the home/locker/ knapsack for thinking ahead.

### 4.2 Connecting computational thinking and program design (22 hours)

> The focus of this topic is how an understanding of programming languages enhances the students’ understanding of computational thinking and provides them with opportunities for practical, hands-on experience of applying computational thinking to practical outcomes. 

> In externally assessed components questions will be presented using flow charts and/or pseudocode as outlined in the approved notation sheet. Answers will only be required in pseudocode.

> Students must be given the opportunity to convert algorithms into working code that is executed and tested.

> Working code will not be assessed in the externally assessed components.

### 5.1 Abstract data structures (23 hours)

> This will be examined at the level of diagrams and pseudocode.
> 
> Students should be able to describe the most common data structures
> (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees) and the most
> common data processing operations on each of the basic data structures
> (addition, deletion and retrieval of data, traversal, searching for a
> given data, sorting of data into some order).
> 
> This should be taught and connected to flow charts, pseudocode and
> programming in the SL/HL core.
> 
> The basic ideas and their application should be illustrated with
> non-computer examples. Each basic idea should then be practised in
> specific algorithmic contexts using concepts drawn from flow charts,
