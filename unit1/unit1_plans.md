## Day 2 - First day of Programming
* Algorithm
* Get set up on Github Classroom - add github names to roster, etc.
* Push out Assignment 1 and have students begin work on it in randomly generated partnerships, but EVERYBODY installs/works.
  * Interact with partnerships. Make sure they understand what's going on.
    * What do you think the quotes are for on "thanos"?
    * What's typescript and how is it different from javascript?
  * After 20 minutes, have students pause and show explicitly how to commit / submit. Let them know they can re-submit before next class for homework if they have not completed.
* Go back to notes; [programming notes](02_FirstFunction.md). Make flashcards or complete for homework.
