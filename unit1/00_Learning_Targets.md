# Unit 1 Learning Targets

## SL

- Recognize and explain the uses of the types of computer memory ([2.1.2](../unit0/syllabus.md#212), [2.1.3](../unit0/syllabus.md#213), [2.1.5](../unit0/syllabus.md#215))

- Understand the need for different data types in programming language and be able to recognize and describe the most important ones - strings, numbers, booleans. ([2.1.9](../unit0/syllabus.md#219) and [2.1.10](../unit0/syllabus.md#2110), [D.1.9](../unit0/syllabus.md#D19))

- Understand the role of sub-program or function, how it receives inputs, and how it returns outputs, and be able to construct and interpret sub-functions in TypeScript. ([4.3.12](../unit0/syllabus.md#4312), [D.1.10](../unit0/syllabus.md#D110))

- Describe the characteristics of a generic collection and work with them (as arrays) in programming languages, especially TypeScript. ([4.3.10](../unit0/syllabus.md#4310), [4.3.11](../unit0/syllabus.md#4311))

- Analyze an algorithm presented as pseudocode and a flowchart, including algorithms with simple loops and conditionals, variables, and collections. ([4.2.4](../unit0/syllabus.md#424), [4.2.5](../unit0/syllabus.md#425), [4.2.9](../unit0/syllabus.md#429))

- Discuss the purpose of a computer programming language and identify its benefits over working directly with the fundamental operations of a computer. ([4.3.1](../unit0/syllabus.md#431) - [4.3.5](../unit0/syllabus.md#435))

- Recognize and correctly use the terms variable, constant, literal expression, operator, =, â‰ , &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, mod (`%`), and div and be able to work with and use them in TypeScript. ([4.3.6](../unit0/syllabus.md#436))

## HL

ALL SL learning targets, plus:

- Identify various types of computer resources, evaluate their availability in common computer types, and outline problems that may arise from their limitations. ([6.1.1](../unit0/syllabus.md#611) - [6.1.4](../unit0/syllabus.md#614))
