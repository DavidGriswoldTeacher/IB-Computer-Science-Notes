# Unit 1 Learning Targets

## SL

* Recognize and explain the uses of the types of computer memory (2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.5)
  
* Understand the need for different data types in programming language how they are represented in decimal, binary, and hexadecimal. (2.1.9 and 2.1.10, D.1.9)

* Understand the role of sub-program or function, how it receives inputs, and how it returns outputs. (4.3.12, D.1.10)

* Describe the characteristics of a generic collection and work with them (as arrays) in programming languages (4.3.10, 4.3.11)
  
* Analyze an algorithm presented as pseudocode and a flowchart, includng algorithms with simple loops and conditionals, variables, and collections. (4.2.4, 4.2.5, 4.2.9)

* Discuss the purpose of a computer programming language and identify its benefits over working directly with the fundamental operaions of a computer. (4.3.1 - 4.3.5)
  
* Recognize and correctly use the terms variable, constant, literal expression, operator, object, =, â‰ , &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;= . (4.3.6)

## HL

ALL SL learning targets, plus:

* Identify various types of computer resources, evaluate their availability in common computer types, and outline problems that may arise from their limitations. (6.1.1 - 6.1.4)
