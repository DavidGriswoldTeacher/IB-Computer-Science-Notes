# All Algorithms We have Traced This year

As we trace new algorithms in class, I will add them to this page as reference, with solutions. 

## Unit 1

### First algorithm ever!

This was done on August 6 in HL, August 7 in SL

#### Algorithm

#### Solution

Hover or tap the region below to see the solution.

```
K:  47  37  26  14
N:  10  11  12  13
D:  37  26  14  1
 
Output: 47  37  26  14
```

### Algorithm 2

This was done on August 8 in HL, August 9 in SL

#### Algorithm

#### Solution

Hover or tap the region below to see the solution.

```
Run 1
T: 42 31 20 9
F: 11 
Output: 9

Run 2
T: 19 9
F: 10
Output: 9

Run 3
T: 25 20 15 10 5 0
F: 5
Output: 0

The output is the REMAINDER when T is divided by F.

### Algorithm 3

This was done on August 12 in HL, August 13 in SL. This comes directly from the May 2018 SL Paper.

#### Prior Knowledge Needed

You need to know that `A mod B` means "The remainder when A is divided by B". So the value of `11 mod 3` is `2`, because 11/3 is 3 with a remainder of 2.

You also need to know that `A div B` means to do division but drop the decimal part (not round, just ignore it!) So the value of `11 div 3` is 3.
