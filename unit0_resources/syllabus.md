## Topic 4—Computational thinking, problem-solving and programming (45 hours)

### 4.1 General principles (10 hours)

> This should not be taught as a separate topic but must be incorporated
> and connected to all sections— especially flow charts, pseudocode and
> programming in the SL/HL core and abstract data structures (HL
> extension). It is essential that these elements are not addressed in
> isolation—they have to be approached as a whole.
> 
> The basic ideas and their application should be illustrated with
> non-computer examples. Each basic idea should then be practised in
> specific algorithmic contexts using concepts drawn from flow charts,
> pseudocode and programming. The teacher support material illustrates
> examples such as the home/locker/ knapsack for thinking ahead.

> 
> Students must be given the opportunity to convert algorithms into
> working code that is executed and tested.

## Topic 5—Abstract data structures (23 hours)

### 5.1 Abstract data structures (23 hours)

> This will be examined at the level of diagrams and pseudocode.
> 
> Students should be able to describe the most common data structures
> (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees) and the most
> common data processing operations on each of the basic data structures
> (addition, deletion and retrieval of data, traversal, searching for a
> given data, sorting of data into some order).
> 
> This should be taught and connected to flow charts, pseudocode and
> programming in the SL/HL core.
> 
> The basic ideas and their application should be illustrated with
> non-computer examples. Each basic idea should then be practised in
> specific algorithmic contexts using concepts drawn from flow charts,
> pseudocode and programming.
